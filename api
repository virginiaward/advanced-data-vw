What URL would you use to get a list of the the most recent votes in the House?
https://api.propublica.org/congress/v1/house/votes/recent.json
How about to get a list of all members of Congress from Missouri?
https://api.propublica.org/congress/v1/members/senate/MO/current.json 
The New York Times used a version of this API to do this interactive about the sequence of votes leading up to the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. How would you use the API to get the information about these votes? Hint: The votes were on April 6/7, 2017.
https://api.propublica.org/congress/v1/senate/votes/2017-04-06/2017-04-07.json
 
In this response, which details all members leaving office, how would you get the first and last name of the first result in the list? (Hint: Use dictionary and list lookup syntax ...)
import json import requests
API_KEY = 'OylOqGPorg2UjpgDMgoGnVtRBKDhcNn7q6XF0rVb'
url = 'https://api.propublica.org/congress/v1/115/house/members/leaving.json'
response = requests.get(url, headers={"X-API-Key": API_KEY}).content
data = json.loads(response)
print data['results'][0]['members'][0]['first_name'], data['results'][0]['members'][0]['last_name']
