I downloaded street-racing-analysis from the Los Angeles Times. I wasn't sure if it would be an interactive or a collection of data, and it ended up being a collection of both. After I looked through the data, I read the story online and found that they made a stacked horizontal bar chart and a map, but neither were interactive. Instead, the data was used to support detailed reporting that was backed up by numbers. I had trouble understanding a lot of the files when I opened them in a text editor, but I could understand what they were tracking when I opened up a CSV folder that listed information about individuals that died in street racing accidents. In CAR with David Herzog, we worked on csv files in SQL pretty often, and I'd like to see how they can be built upon in text editors. I'm not sure what input or output mean. CPG each contained an ISO code. I believe their dbf file was listing coordinates to map where fatalities happened. Their geojson listed coordinates and number of deaths at each coordinate. In a py file, they wrote about their problem with null values when calculating the per capita rate. I thought their repository was very organized, and several files provided explanation as to why they were exploring different numbers.
